# SearchFundOS UX Spec
## Mental Models & Core Screens
1. **Global Identity (/login)**: Split-screen auth and irreversible role selection (Searcher vs Investor).
2. **Searcher Dashboard**: High-level pulse check and metric aggregation.
3. **Sourcing Universe**: Highly optimized spreadsheet for top-of-funnel targets. Bulk actions to convert to Deals.
4. **Deal Pipeline**: Kanban board. Drag-and-drop progression. Distinct privacy badges (Tier 1 vs Tier 2).
5. **Deal Detail & Workspace**: Hub-and-spoke centralized dossier. Strict privacy toggles.
6. **AI P&L Extraction**: Split-screen validation. Ground truth PDF on left, editable JSON form on right.
7. **Investor Portfolio Dashboard**: Read-only command center tracking connected Searchers.
8. **Deal Flow Network Feed**: Curated, read-only marketplace feed of Tier 2 deals shared by Searchers.
