# AI Project Status
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Implementation
**Last Completed Task:** Task: Renaming SearchFundOS to Ceeq - COMPLETE
**Next Task:** Phase 2 - Feature Development
**Active Blockers:** None

**Notes:**
- Shadcn/ui configured with strict path mapping to `src/shared/components/ui/`.
- Design tokens codified in `src/app/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`.
- Verified Layouts implementation against test script `tests/layouts.test.js`.
- Regression check for Task 1.1 passed: No layout bleeding detected.
- Implemented Dummy Auth Provider for dev/mock mode.
- Validated API Mocking and Auth Bypass logic with execution scripts `verify_api_client.ts` and `verify_auth_bypass.ts`.

**Current File Structure:**
- `src/shared/components/providers`:
    - `dummy-auth-provider.tsx`: Mock authentication context.
- `src/app/(auth)`:
    - `layout.tsx`: Auth layout shell.
    - `/login`: Authentication entry point (redirects in mock mode).
    - `/onboarding`: User onboarding flow.
- `src/app/(searcher)`:
    - `layout.tsx`: Searcher layout with sidebar.
    - `/searcher/dashboard`: Searcher main dashboard.
    - `/searcher/pipeline`: Deal pipeline view.
    - `/searcher/universe`: Target universe exploration.
- `src/app/(investor)`:
    - `layout.tsx`: Investor layout with distinct sidebar.
    - `/investor/dashboard`: Investor overview.
    - `/investor/deals`: Investment opportunities.

**Technical Decisions:**
- Implemented base routing skeleton using Next.js Route Groups and strict React Server Components. Root page configured to redirect to /login.
- Implemented @tanstack/react-query for server state, next-themes for appearance, and @supabase/ssr for authenticated data fetching.
- Added Repomix Context Packer with XML output and strict secret exclusion.
- Implemented synchronous state initialization in `DummyAuthProvider` to support SSR and avoid hydration mismatches when `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=true`.
- Implemented `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS` pattern. Added `api.ts` fetch wrapper with request interception. Created `DummyAuthProvider` to bypass Supabase and auto-route to dashboards during UI dev.
- Refactored `DummyAuthProvider` and `RootPage` logic into pure functions (`getInitialUser`, `getRedirectPath`) to enable standalone verification without full component rendering.
- Moved `getRedirectPath` to `src/shared/lib/auth-utils.ts` to avoid Next.js invalid page export errors.
- Successfully passed initial static analysis, linting, and production build steps.

### CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE_SNAPSHOT
- **Route Groups & Layouts**:
  - `(auth)`: Login, Onboarding. (Centered Layout)
  - `(searcher)`: Dashboard, Universe, Pipeline. (Sidebar Layout)
  - `(investor)`: Dashboard, Deals. (Sidebar Layout)
- **Providers**:
  - `ThemeProvider` (next-themes)
  - `QueryProvider` (@tanstack/react-query)
  - `DummyAuthProvider` (Mock Auth)
- **Global State/Data**:
  - `src/shared/lib/api.ts`: Centralized fetch wrapper with mock interception.
  - `src/shared/lib/auth-utils.ts`: Auth redirection logic.
